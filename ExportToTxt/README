-Open in Visual Studio and run program
-Select filepath to project, language type, and type of export
-"Glossary" pulls a very messy list of all strings of specified language, but allows for quick "ctrl-f" searches within the text editor
-"Standard" pulls strings out, throws them into a new excel document, and removes any duplicate strings for a nice readable format for translators

Note: Currently, code looks for a "Glossary" or "Standard" folder within path, as per request when I created it.
Also looks for designated language folders in path, such as "Spanish" if you choose "ESN". Can be modified to work
universally with a few small changes.
